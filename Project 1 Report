History
In the early seventies(1) Gregory Yobb discovered the People's Computer
Company and after seeing a selection of their games he found himself
disappointed that each game he saw used a 10x10 grid(2). This
disappointment inspired Yobb to create a game that was not based on a
grid but was instead a twisting series of caves. Thus, Hunt The Wumpus 
was born. Hunt The Wumpus became very popular very quickly(1) and even
today it has been remade in both its original text-based form and
graphical forms many times and it has even been remade for mobile devices
and now our task is to remake the game once more for our first project.

Design
//Dan & Matt's design elements need to be explained first
When designing the AI we decided that it had to meet the following criteria:
1.It had to move in a random direction unless it had information about nearby danger or treasure
2.It had to asses the risk in moving from a given square based on the number of surrounding dangers
3.It had to endeavour to find the treasure and the exit when they were adjacent

we met the first criteria by simply adding a line of code that would make the AI pick a random direction
and then move in that direction but only if there was no other information that would effect how it moved.
The second was met by counting the number of dangerous squares adjacent to the AI and if there were two or more the 
AI was told to move back on its next turn. If less than two dangers were found then the AI would move in a 
random direction. The third criteria was met by making the AI move into a random square after dfiscovering the 
treasure was nearby. If the chosen square did not have the treasure then the AI was told to go back where it 
would try again(this is assuming of course that there was nothing dangerous in that particular square).
